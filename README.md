# Caribbean_ROV


In this project we have made a device, which can measure the temperature and humidity. The device contains a temperature sensor, 
a humidity sensor and an LCD Screen to display the reading in addition to an Arduino Nano to control the whole system. The system 
in implemented in a cuboid on Acrylic (11cm * 8cm * 4cm). The system is compact in size so that it can be placed anywhere home, 
office, school, library… etc. The system can also measure the maximum and average temperature in addition to measuring the maximum 
and average humidity. 

This was designed as a part of University project Under Supervision of Dr. Walid Ghoneim
